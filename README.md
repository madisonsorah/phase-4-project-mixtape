# phase-4-project
This project is a music discovery platform for sharing custom playlists. Members can submit a playlist request with a brief description, whether they are looking for songs based on their mood, a genre or a specific artist, etc, and another member can share a Spotify URL to a playlist that they have curated based on those preferences. Each member will have a profile page where a short bio and playlists that they have created and received will appear. Members can also be discovered through the “Recently Curated” section, which updates with newly created playlists that can be “hearted” and saved to another member’s “Listen Later” list on their account page, even if they have not directly requested it.
